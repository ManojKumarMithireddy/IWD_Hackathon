"#Theme : The Growing Crisis of E-Waste"

Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document
1.	Problem Statement
The improper disposal of electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing environmental issue. Many people do not have easy ways to recycle old electronics, leading to pollution. At the same time, industries that recycle e-waste face difficulties in sourcing discarded electronics efficiently.
This project aims to create a web platform that connects users who want to dispose of e-waste with industries that recycle it. Users can request e-waste collection and receive rewards, while industries can request collected e-waste at negotiable prices. The platform also includes a leaderboard to encourage participation and a map to show nearby collection points. This system promotes responsible e-waste disposal and supports recycling efforts.
2.	Solution
The E-Waste Web Application is a digital platform designed to facilitate e-waste collection and recycling by enabling seamless interactions between users and industries. The key functionalities include:
For Normal Users:
- Users can post a request for an agent to collect e-waste from their location.
- Upon successful collection, users receive incentives such as coupons and badges.
- A leaderboard system ranks the top participants based on their contributions.
- A map feature displays nearby collection stops to help users find drop-off points.
For Industries:
- Industries can request collected e-waste for a specific price or negotiate a deal.
- They can view and manage e-waste requests through a simple interface.
